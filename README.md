This project is an interactive Sales Dashboard built to analyze and visualize the performance of a fictional superstore. The dataset contains detailed information about orders, sales, shipping, customer segments, and more.

The dashboard offers insights across various dimensions like:

. State-wise and Region-wise Sales
. Time-wise Sales Trends (Monthly/Yearly)
. Ship Mode-wise Sales
. Customer Segment-wise Performance
. Category and Sub-Category Analysis

The goal of this dashboard is to help stakeholders quickly understand the sales performance, identify profitable areas, and detect bottlenecks or underperforming segments.
